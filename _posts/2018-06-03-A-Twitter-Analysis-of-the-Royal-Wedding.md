title: The Royal Wedding of 2018 - A Twitter Analysis
---

Even though England has been a constitutional monarchy since 1689, anything related to the Royal Family always attracts the public eye. Recently, the Royal Family has portrayed itself as an entity that is more open to the public, especially with the new generation of the family that is younger and more energetic. Not surprisingly, people around the world are drawn into big events surrounding the yet mysterious family, especially when it is the wedding of the prince, marrying Meghan Markel, someone who comes from a very different background yet so special to the family as a whole. 

My emotions aside (Meghan graduated from **my** alma mater - Northwestern University), I wanted to see if I can use Twitter data to analyze what people talked about during, and after the wedding, as well as people's general emotional state towards the new couple & the Royal Family.
